C      Description:     The first frame in this example demonstrates how
C                       to set the view port for a contour plot.
C                       Note: no data is used in this example, so the
C                       output appears only as a bounding box with
C                       tickmarks.
C
C                       The second frame in this example demonstrates how
C                       to produce multiple plots on a single frame.

C Create a plot object.  In this example, we will create a contour plot.
C
C Four view class resources, vpXF, vpYF, vpWidthF, and vpHeightF, are
C assigned values in the following create call.  The combination of
C these four resources determines where the plot will display in the
C output window.  The values of these resources are specified in 
C Normalized Device Coordinates (NDCs).  In this two-dimensional
C coordinate system (0,0) specifies the lower-left corner and (1,1)
C specifies the upper-right corner of a plot.

      call NhlFRLClear(rlist)
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpXF",0.05,ierr) 
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpYF",0.95,ierr)

     $     rlist,ierr)
C
C Draw the plot. 
C
      call NhlFDraw(con1,ierr)
C
C The frame call updates and then clears the workstation.
C Anything written to the workstation after a frame call is made will be
C drawn in a subsequent frame. 
C
      call NhlFFrame(wks,ierr)

C This example demonstrates drawing multiple plots in a single frame.
C
C Calling draw again will produce the identical plot that was drawn in
C the first frame.
C
      call NhlFDraw(con1,ierr)
C
C To add another plot to the same frame, we first need to reset the 
C viewport resources so that the next plot does not overwrite the first
C one.  The setvalues expression is used to set resources after an object
C has already been created.  The first argument, "con1", in the setvalues
C expression specifies an object id of a plot that was generated earlier
C with the create call.  This is then followed by a list of resource
C value pairs that apply to the object.
C
      call NhlFRLClear(rlist)
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpXF",0.55,ierr) 
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpYF",0.45,ierr) 
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpWidthF",0.2,ierr) 
      call NhlFRLSetFloat(rlist,"vpHeightF",0.2,ierr) 
      call NhlFSetValues(con1,rlist,ierr)
C
C Because of the new viewport resource settings, calling draw produces 
C a plot in the lower-right quadrant of the frame.
C
      call NhlFDraw(con1,ierr)
C
C Updates and clear the workstation.
C
      call NhlFFrame(wks,ierr)
C
C Clean up (destroying the parent object recursively destroys all of its 
C children).
C
      call NhlFDestroy(con1,ierr)
      call NhlFClose

      stop
      end
