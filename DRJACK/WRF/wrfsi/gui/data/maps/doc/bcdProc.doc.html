This program is a standalone program for performing operations on WFO
Advanced .bcd (binary cartographic data files) or .bcx files (extended
binary cartographic data files), which are the file formats that the
workstation actually reads to draw map backgrounds. A .bcd file contains
vector data in lat/lon coordinates. A .bcx is esentially a .bcd file
with a text string associated with each record. Both input and output
are assumed to be the same file type.

The program allows the user 6 different operations which can be
performed on either .bcd or .bcx files except where noted.  These are
summarized here and explained in detail below:

- remove identical vectors
- clip based on a depictor file
- collapse short vectors
- clip an ASCII file based on a depictor file
- clip an ASCII file based on a depictor file with lat/lon units conversion
- convert an ASCII file to a bcd file
- shorten records to a standard length


For the mode that removes identical vectors, the usage is as follows:

bcdProc r {x} input_file output_file

r: the letter `r'
x (optional): if the letter `x' is present, assume .bcx file.
input_file: pathname of file to read.
output_file: pathname of file to write.


For the mode that clips based on a depictor file, the usage is as follows:

bcdProc c {x} input_file depictor output_file

c: the letter `c'
x (optional): if the letter `x' is present, assume .bcx file.
input_file: pathname of file to read.
depictor: pathname of depictor file (.sup file) to clip with.
output_file: pathname of file to write.


For the mode that collapses short vectors, the usage is as follows:

bcdProc t {x} input_file dist output_file

t: the letter `t'
x (optional): if the letter `x' is present, assume .bcx file.
input_file: pathname of file to read.
dist: vectors shorter that this distance in km will be collapsed.
output_file: pathname of file to write.


For the mode that converts an ASCII file to a bcd file, the usage is as
follows:

bcdProc b {x} input_file output_file

b: the letter `b'
x (optional): if the letter `x' is present, assume .bcx file.
input_file: pathname of file to read.
output_file: pathname of file to write.


This mode reads lines from an ASCII file, finds first two consecutive
space-delimited words that can be a lat/lon, and removes the record
if that lat/lon is not within the area of the depictor file. To be
a lat/lon, a word must contain a decimal point and represent a floating
point number within the allowable range of values for lats and lons in
degrees. The usage is as follows:

bcdProc a input_file depictor output_file

a: the letter `a'
input_file: pathname of file to read.
depictor: pathname of depictor file (.sup file) to clip with.
output_file: pathname of file to write.


This mode reads lines from an ASCII file, find first two consecutive
space-delimited words that can be a lat/lon, and removes the record
if that lat/lon is not within the area of the depictor file. To be
a lat/lon, a word must represent a floating point or integer number.
This mode can perform units conversions on lats and lons. Validity of
number as a lat/lon is checked after the units conversion.
The usage is as follows:

bcdProc i input_file depictor output_file {c1} {latmult} {lonmult}

i: the letter `i'
input_file: pathname of file to read.
depictor: pathname of depictor file (.sup file) to clip with.
output_file: pathname of file to write.
c1 (optional): Number of characters to skip in each line of text before
               trying to find lats and lons.  Defaults to 0.
latmult (optional): Units conversion for latitudes, defaults to 1.
lonmult (optional): Units conversion for latitudes, defaults to 1.


This mode reads a bcd or bcx file that may not have records truncated
to the standard number of points (currently 500) and writes out a
file with records that are truncated in that manner.
The usage is as follows:

bcdProc s {x} input_file output_file

s: the letter `s'
x (optional): if the letter `x' is present, assume .bcx file.
input_file: pathname of file to read.
depictor: pathname of depictor file (.sup file) to clip with.
output_file: pathname of file to write.
