NCL License

IMPORTANT!

PLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE ("LICENSE") CAREFULLY. INDICATE YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS BY CHECKING THE "I have read and hereby
accept the NCL License Agreement" ON THE REGISTRATION PAGE. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND YOU DO NOT CHECK THE
"I ACCEPT" BOX, THE INSTALLATION PROCESS WILL NOT CONTINUE.

1. License. This is a license to use the NCAR Command Language
   ("NCL" or the "Software"). The Software accompanying this
   License, whether on disk, in read-only memory, or on any other
   media is licensed, not sold, to you on a personal, nonexclusive
   basis by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
   ("UCAR"). YOU OWN THE MEDIA ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS RECORDED
   BUT UCAR RETAINS TITLE TO THE SOFTWARE.

2. Permitted Uses and Restrictions. This License allows you to use
   the Software and any associated documentation for any lawful
   purpose; provided, however, that you do not sell, or license or
   transfer for a fee, the Software, or any work that in any manner
   contains the Software. If you make derivative works that
   incorporate or utilize the Software, you must not sell or
   commercially distribute the derivative work. YOU CANNOT SELL
   THIS SOFTWARE OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS THAT INCORPORATE OR
   UTILIZE OR ARE CREATED FROM THE SOFTWARE. These restrictions
   apply only to the software, not to images and data produced as a
   result of using the software. Except for the rights expressly
   granted herein, this License gives you no rights to the source
   code for the Software. You agree not to attempt to decompile,
   disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise discover such source
   code.

3. Notices. If you make copies of the Software, each copy must
   include all copyright information and notices contained on the
   original. Such notices shall be displayed on any documents,
   media, printouts, and visualizations or on any other electronic
   or tangible expressions associated with, related to or derived
   from the Software or associated documentation. NOTICE: NCAR
   Command Language is the sole and exclusive property of the
   University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Copyright@2005
   University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. All Rights
   Reserved.

4. Termination. Your rights under this License will terminate
   automatically without notice from UCAR if you fail to comply with
   any term(s) of this License. You may terminate this License at any
   time by destroying the Software and any related documentation and
   any complete or partial copies thereof. Upon termination, all rights
   granted under this License shall terminate. Provisions of this
   License that, by their nature, contemplate continued effect after
   termination, shall survive termination, including paragraphs 2, 6,
   7, and 9.

5. Web Linking. You agree that the search screens, result screens or
   any screens on any Web site where the Software is installed will
   contain: (a) a notice that the site is "Powered by NCL" and (b) at
   least one hyperlink to http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/. You can obtain
   information about establishing such link by contacting Mary Haley.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty on Software. You expressly acknowledge and
   agree that use of the Software is at your sole risk. The Software is
   provided "AS IS" and without warranty of any kind and UCAR EXPRESSLY
   DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
   CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. UCAR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS
   CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE
   OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR
   THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. FURTHERMORE, UCAR
   DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR
   THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN
   TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE
   PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THE APPLICABILITY OF THE UNIFORM
   COMPUTER INFORMATION TRANSACTIONS ACT (UCITA). No oral or written
   information or advice given by UCAR or a UCAR authorized
   representative shall create a warranty or in any way increase the
   scope of this warranty. Should the Software prove defective, you
   (and not UCAR or any UCAR representative) assume the cost of all
   necessary correction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
   of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

7. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE, SHALL UCAR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING LOST REVENUE,
   PROFIT, OR DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT ARISING
   OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE,
   EVEN IF UCAR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. Export Law Assurances. All Software and any technical data
   delivered under this License are subject to U.S. export control
   laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other
   countries. You agree to comply strictly with all such laws and
   regulations and you acknowledge that you have responsibility to
   obtain such license to export, re-export, or import as may be
   required after delivery to you.

9. No Support/Modifications. The Software is provided without any
   support or maintenance, and without any obligation to provide
   you with modifications, improvements, enhancements, or updates
   of the Software.

10. Controlling Law and Severability. This License shall be governed
    by the laws of the United States and the State of Colorado. If
    for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
    provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the
    remainder of this License shall continue in full force and
    effect. This License shall not be governed by the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the
    application of which is hereby expressly excluded.

11. Complete Agreement. This License constitutes the entire
    agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the
    Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
    understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or
    modification of this License will be binding unless in a writing
    and signed by UCAR.
