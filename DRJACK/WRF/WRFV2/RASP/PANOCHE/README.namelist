Description of namelist variables
---------------------------------
 
For WRF-NMM users, please see Chapter 5 of the WRF-NMM User's Guide for 
information on NMM specific settings (http://www.dtcenter.org/wrf-nmm/users)


 Note: variables followed by (max_dom) indicate that this variable needs to
       be defined for the nests when max_dom > 1.

 &time_control
 run_days                            = 1,	; run time in days
 run_hours                           = 0,	; run time in hours
                                                  Note: if it is more than 1 day, one may use both run_days and run_hours
                                                  or just run_hours. e.g. if the total run length is 36 hrs, you may
                                                  set run_days = 1, and run_hours = 12, or run_days = 0, and run_hours = 36
 run_minutes                         = 0,	; run time in minutes
 run_seconds                         = 0,	; run time in seconds
 start_year (max_dom)                = 2001,	; four digit year of starting time
 start_month (max_dom)               = 06,	; two digit month of starting time
 start_day (max_dom)                 = 11,	; two digit day of starting time
 start_hour (max_dom)                = 12,	; two digit hour of starting time
 start_minute (max_dom)              = 00,	; two digit minute of starting time
 start_second (max_dom)              = 00,	; two digit second of starting time
                                                  Note: the start time is used to name the first wrfout file.
                                                  It also controls the start time for nest domains, and the time to restart
 end_year (max_dom)                  = 2001,	; four digit year of ending time
 end_month (max_dom)                 = 06,	; two digit month of ending time
 end_day (max_dom)                   = 12,	; two digit day of ending time
 end_hour (max_dom)                  = 12,	; two digit hour of ending time
 end_minute (max_dom)                = 00,	; two digit minute of ending time
 end_second (max_dom)                = 00,	; two digit second of ending time
                                                  It also controls when the nest domain integrations end
                                                  All start and end times are used by real.exe.

                                                  Note that one may use either run_days/run_hours etc. or 
                                                  end_year/month/day/hour etc. to control the length of 
                                                  model integration. But run_days/run_hours
                                                  takes precedence over the end times. 
                                                  Program real.exe uses start and end times only.

                                                  surface fields are used.

                                                  into smaller pieces
 restart                             = F,	; whether this run is a restart run

 debug_level                         = 0, 	; 50,100,200,300 values give increasing prints

Other output options:

 auxhist2_outname                    = "rainfall" ; file name for extra output; if not specified,
                                                  auxhist2_d<domain>_<date> will be used
                                                  also note that to write variables in output other
                                                  than the history file requires Registry.EM file change
 auxhist2_interval                   = 10,      ; interval in minutes
 io_form_auxhist2                    = 2,       ; output in netCDF

Additional ones when running 3DVAR:

 inputout_end_s                      = 0        ; the above shows that the input-formatted data are output
                                                  starting from hour 3 to hour 12 in 180 min interval.

                                                  recommend 6*dx (in km) for typical real-data cases

                                                  Example, if you want to use 60.3 sec as your time step,
                                                  set time_step = 60, time_step_fract_num = 3, and 
                                                  time_step_fract_den = 10

                                                  vertical dimensions need to be the same for all nests
                                                  Note: most variables are unstaggered (= staggered dim - 1)
 dx (max_dom)                        = 10000,	; grid length in x direction, unit in meters
 dy (max_dom)                        = 10000,	; grid length in y direction, unit in meters

                                                  the ratio has to be odd; for idealized cases,
                                                  the ratio can be even if feedback is set to 0.

Namelist variables for controling the specified moving nest: 
                   Note that this moving nest option needs to be activated at the compile time by adding -DMOVE_NESTS
                   to the ARCHFLAGS. The maximum number of moves, max_moves, is set to 50 
                   but can be modified in source code file frame/module_driver_constants.F.
 num_moves                           = 4        ; total number of moves
 move_id                             = 2,2,2,2, ; a list of nest domain id's, one per move
 move_interval                       = 60,120,150,180,   ; time in minutes since the start of this domain
 move_cd_x                           = 1,1,0,-1,; the number of parent domain grid cells to move in i direction
 move_cd_y                           = 1,0,-1,1,; the number of parent domain grid cells to move in j direction
                                                  positive is to move in increasing i and j direction, and 
                                                  negative is to move in decreasing i and j direction.
                                                  0 means no move. The limitation now is to move only 1 grid cell
                                                  at each move.

Namelist variables for controling the automatic moving nest: 
                   Note that this moving nest option needs to be activated at the compile time by adding -DMOVE_NESTS
                   and -DVORTEX_CENTER to the ARCHFLAGS. This option uses an mid-level vortex following algorthm to
                   determine the nest move. This option is experimental.
 vortex_interval                     = 15       ; how often the new vortex position is computed
 max_vortex_speed                    = 40       ; used to compute the search radius for the new vortex position
 corral_dist                         = 8        ; how many coarse grid cells the moving nest is allowed to get
                                                  near the mother domain boundary

 &physics

 Note: even the physics options can be different in different nest domains, 
       caution must be used as what options are sensible to use
